# NCHeatExchangerCalc
An attempt at a calculation utility for the Heat Exchanger multiblocks in the NuclearCraft mod: https://github.com/turbodiesel4598/NuclearCraft


This project was built using the Qt toolkit, which can be downloaded in binary or source form here: https://www.qt.io/download . THis is not necessary unlesds you want to build from source. If you do want to build from source, I recommend this guide: https://retifrav.github.io/blog/2018/02/17/build-qt-statically/ to prevent needing more than the application's file size in external dlls.

This project is licensed under LGPL v3 to keep with the licensing requirements for Qt. I personally don't care what you decide to do with this code as all the math came from turbodiesel4598 and all I did was put it behind a button.
